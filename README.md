# rotate_number_puzzle
This is solution code for "Magic Number" puzzle from "Brain Training - Logic Puzzles" game. Another name for this puzzle is rotate number puzzle. Normally I would explain briefly about my program, but I am not in the mood rn so just telling you don't waste your time on these type of passion. Anyway, I am truly happy to be able to solve(auto-solve) this puzzle. In this puzzle the main points are - moving blocks to up, down, left, right... and Third part, which is the formula I founded by myself and so proud of it. The formula is how to interchange two adjacent numbers without messing the neighbouring numbers. I didn't use any google for this puzzle-solving coding session, so improved I guess. This puzzle is a little similar to my solved one of puzzles called "Slider Numbers". So be my guest and judge my programs.
